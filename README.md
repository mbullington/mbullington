## Hi, I'm Michael!

I'm a software developer who's passionate about building user interfaces. I build experiences for the web, mobile, and cloud. I have an always-improving knowledge of client-side JavaScript architecture :hammer:, mapping technologies :globe_with_meridians:, and am currently excited by Flutter :hatched_chick:. Fan of work travel... but currently quarantining! :house_with_garden: :mask:

I'm also a college student :school_satchel:, and contribute back to the open source community.

You can check out my projects below, visit [my personal site](bullington.xyz), or [get in touch!](michael@bullington.xyz)
